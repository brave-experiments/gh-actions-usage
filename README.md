# GH Actions Usage
GitHub CLI extension for measuring the billable usage of GitHub Actions in the current billing period.

*Note that this doesn't include self-hosted runners, which don't incur billable time on GitHub Actions.*

I wrote a version of this extension before the Golang support was available for `gh`, which is still available [here](https://github.com/geoffreywiseman/gh-actuse).

## Features

Display the usage for the current repository:
```
gh-actions-usage on ÓÇ† main [!+] via üêπ v1.19.4
‚ùØ gh actions-usage
GitHub Actions Usage

codiform/gh-actions-usage (2 workflows; 4h 5m):
- CI (.github/workflows/ci.yml, active, 4h 3m)
- release (.github/workflows/release.yml, active, 2m 348ms)
```

Display the usage for a specified repository:
```
gh-actions-usage on ÓÇ† main [!+] via üêπ v1.19.4
‚ùØ gh actions-usage codiform/gh-actions-usage
GitHub Actions Usage

codiform/gh-actions-usage (2 workflows; 1h 1s):
- CI (.github/workflows/ci.yml, active, 59m 20s)
- release (.github/workflows/release.yml, active, 39s 980ms)
```

Display the usage for multiple specified repositories:
```
