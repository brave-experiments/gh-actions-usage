# GH Actions Usage
GitHub CLI extension for measuring the billable usage of GitHub Actions in the current billing period.

*Note that this doesn't include self-hosted runners, which don't incur billable time on GitHub Actions.*

I wrote a version of this extension before the Golang support was available for `gh`, which is still available [here](https://github.com/geoffreywiseman/gh-actuse).

## Features

Display the usage for the current repository:
```
GitHub Actions Usage

MyOrg/MyRepo (2 workflows; 10h 41m):
- CI (.github/workflows/ci.yaml, active, 10h 29m)
- Infrastructure (.github/workflows/infra.yaml, active, 3h 10m)
```       

Display the usage for a specified repository:

```
