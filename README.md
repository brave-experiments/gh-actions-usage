# GH Actions Usage
GitHub CLI extension for measuring the *billable usage* of GitHub Actions in the *current billing period*.

This is all the information that's available through the API currently:
- I can't go beyond the current billing period
- I can't see usage minutes that aren't billable, like self-hosted runners, which don't incur billable time on GitHub Actions

I wrote a version of this extension before the Golang support was available for `gh`, which is still available [here](https://github.com/geoffreywiseman/gh-actuse).

## üì¶ Installation

1. Install the GitHub CLI - see the [installation instructions](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation).
1. Installation requires a minimum version (2.0.0) of the the GitHub CLI that supports extensions.
1. Install this extension: `gh extension install codiform/gh-actions-usage`.
