# GH Actions Usage
GitHub CLI extension for measuring the billable usage of GitHub Actions in the current billing period.

*Note that this doesn't include self-hosted runners, which don't incur billable time on GitHub Actions.*

I wrote a version of this extension before the Golang support was available for `gh`, which is still available [here](https://github.com/geoffreywiseman/gh-actuse).

## Features

Display the usage for the current repository:
```
GitHub Actions Usage

MyOrg/MyRepo (2 workflows; 10h 41m):
- CI (.github/workflows/ci.yaml, active, 10h 29m)
- Infrastructure (.github/workflows/infra.yaml, active, 3h 10m)
```       

Display the usage for a specified repository:
```
‚ùØ gh actions-usage MyOrg/myrepo
GitHub Actions Usage

MyOrg/MyRepo (3 workflows; 8h 39m):
- Build (.github/workflows/build.yaml, active, 8h 33m)
- Deploy (.github/workflows/deploy.yaml, active, 0ms)
- Push (.github/workflows/push.yaml, active, 6m 0s)
```

# Tasks

## To Do
- [ ] Feature: Print Usage for All Workflows in *Current* Repo
  - [ ] If no repo specified, use current repo
  - [ ] If no current repo, explain, and print usage
- [ ] Feature: Print Usage for all repos for named org
  - All repos / enabled repos?
- [ ] Feature: Print Usage for multiple named repos/orgs
- Feature: Print Usage for All Repos for current user
  - Is this possible?
- Feature: Print Usage for All Repos for named user
  - Possible?
- Feature: Host?
- Real Readme
- CLI Options?
  - Do not print workflows with no usage
  - Do not print repos with no workflows
- Option Config?
  - e.g. a config file that specifies options
- Print Version?
  - [embed](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/a-better-way-than-ldflags-to-add-a-build-version-to-your-go-binaries-2258ce419d2d) or ldflags
- Writeup
  - Go implementation
  - Lessons learned
  - Speed comparison

- Feature: Different Formatters?
